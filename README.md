# SoundMode
android switch widget of sound mode

There 3 sound modes for different scenarios.

## 1. Sound
Set ring volume to maximum, turn on vibrate and accept all incoming calls/messages. This mode is for outdoor.

## 2. Vibrate
Turn off ring tone, but turn on vibrate, and accept all incoming calls/messages. I'd like use this mode in bedroom. I wouldn't miss any call/message thanks to vibration, and it won't be too noisy.

## 3. Priority
Turn off ring tone and set ring mode to *Priority* mode (*Priority* mode is a customizable mode introduced by Android 5.0). I prefer set it "notify me nothing but incoming calls". Usually I use this mode when I'm working.
